# Decentwork
Decentwork is a Decent network solution for websites. Instead of the usual model where websites run on a centralised web server collective a website using Decentwork solutions would run on the same devices accessing the network.

# Disclaimer!
Don't use Decentwork as of now because it is unfinished and possibly unsecure, if you are interesting in helping develop you can contact me by opening an Issue or messaging my discord account ib_studios.

# Why?
Gun.js and OrbitDB already handles decentralised database structures meanwhile IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) allows for decentralised file storage, including media, however web servers are still required to actually host the website's basic contents. With Decentwork this will (hopefully) become a thing of a past.

# How?
Very simply, any device with Decentwork can access a website that contains a Decentwork SDK and upon doing so, the data is shared with both the website and the app, allowing the Decentwork app to act as a web server for the basic web data, this website data is slowly spread around multiple different users, evening the load. Any user without the app will be displayed a webpage telling them how they can download Decentwork.

For those interested to use Decentwork
--> If you are a average Joe, you may download a release when Decentwork is finished, or git clone this app to develop on it.
--> If you are interested in using Decentwork in your website, download and add the Decentwork SDK to your website, remember it is not finished, and at some point we plan on making it downloadable as a package so it will be easy to download.

# When?
Decentwork is still under development, it uses a tauri app with a sveltekit frontend and a sdk.

# Decentwork
Decentwork is a Decent network solution for websites. Instead of the usual model where websites run on a centralised web server collective a website using Decentwork solutions would run on the same devices accessing the network.

# Disclaimer!
Don't use Decentwork as of now because it is unfinished and possibly unsecure, if you are interesting in helping develop you can contact me by opening an Issue or messaging my discord account ib_studios.

# Why?
1. For web developers - Server costs can be incredibly high when building a website and the alternatives of using cloud storage and hosting on your own device can be unreliable, unsecure or both, Decentwork allows developers to add an SDK to their website which makes there server costs practically zero which is great for starting out websites and reduces the incentives of monotization and hence corporate greed, it also makes you look cool in comparision to your competiters (or a nerd Idk).
2. For consumers and users - Admittably, while not very large as a website grows and not much of a problem for newer devices, older devices may have drops in performance acting as a host however in return the privacy benefits are immense as no big organisation or person has control of all the data and security vulnerabilities while always prevelant are likely much more localised than with centralised networks (assuming we can actually understand how to make it secure).

# How?
1. Consumers/Users - You have come to the right github repo, this is where you can install the software required for you to access any websites using this technology and temporarily (only while you are accessing the website) become a server although it is required for you to also install our extenstion for your given browser in order to allow you to access these special websites, the ur is here - (Insert uRL).
2. Web Developers - You have come to the wrong repo, the sdk for use on a website is here - (Insert Url) When finished
